# Changelog

## 2.2.3-1.21.1-neoforge

### Added
- **Magnetization addon compatibility** — when the optional Magnetization addon is installed, this mod's iron-bearing items, ores, armor, and tools now participate in its magnetic field interactions via the `magnetization:ferromagnetic`, `magnetization:metal_armor`, `magnetization:metal_tools`, and `magnetization:ferromagnetic_blocks` tags. Inclusion criterion: any set whose recipe chain transitively contains iron — including composite ingots like `RGOLD`, `RLAPIS`, `SEM`, and `OBINGOT` which all use iron nuggets or ingots.
  - Ferromagnetic items: `rgold`, `raw_rgold`, `obingot`, `rlapis`, `sem`
  - Metal armor: copper, rgold, obsidian, fni (Flint-Iron), rlapis, emerald, overpower full sets
  - Metal tools: copper, rgold, pobsidian, fni, rraw_iron, rraw_copper, rraw_gold, rraw_rgold, rscrap, rlapis, pemerald full tool sets, plus overpower sword/pickaxe/axe/shovel
  - Ferromagnetic blocks: all four `rgold` ore variants (overworld/deepslate/nether/end), `rgoldblock`, `raw_rgold_block`, `lblock`, `semblock`, `soblock`
  - Tag JSONs are emitted unconditionally; they're inert when Magnetization isn't installed, so no runtime gate is needed. Magnetization is listed as an `optional` dependency in `neoforge.mods.toml` for metadata clarity.
- **Just Enough Resources (JER) integration** — when JER is installed, all four Ferrous Gold Ore variants (overworld, deepslate, nether, end) are registered with JER's WorldGen tab so players see the Y-distribution graph and drops next to vanilla iron/copper/etc. Registration happens during common setup against `JERAPI.getInstance()` directly, bypassing JER 1.6.0.17's broken `@JERPlugin` annotation scanner; the same approach [JER Integration](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jer-integration) uses. The plugin class loads lazily behind `ModList.isLoaded("jeresources")`, so JER imports stay inert when the mod isn't present.

## 2.2.2-1.21.1-neoforge

Parity sync with the 2.2.2 Fabric release. All fixes mirror the Fabric variant.

### Fixed
- **Spectral / Spectral-Infused armor mix-and-match** — wearing a mix of native Spectral armor and ectoplasm-infused pieces now correctly hides the player from Ghosts. Previously the check was either-or (4 native or 4 infused), so any mixed loadout failed both branches and Ghosts could still see the player. (`EctoplasmArmorHelper.isGhostInvisible`)
- **Spectral-Infused armor tooltip** — infused armor incorrectly showed "Can damage Ghosts". Armor doesn't damage Ghosts; tools/weapons do. Infused armor now reads "Hides you from Ghosts"; the damage line stays on tools and weapons. (new lang key `tooltip.usefultoolsmod.ecto_armor_invisibility`)
- **Ghost spawn egg ignores config rate** — using a Ghost Spawn Egg (or `/summon`, breeding, etc.) only succeeded ~15% of the time because `FinalizeSpawnEvent` was discarding any Ghost that failed `Config.ghostSpawnChance`, regardless of how it spawned. The rate gate has been moved into the spawn predicate (`GhostEntity.checkGhostSpawnRules`), which Minecraft only consults during natural spawning. Spawn eggs and commands now always succeed; the kill-switch (`ghostEnabled = false`) still discards on finalize.
- **Datagen completeness**: `ModBlockTagProvider` and `ModRecipeProvider` were missing the `needs/incorrect_recto_tool` block tags and the grenade/dynamite recipes (the static resources covered them at jar build time, but a fresh `runData` would have lost them). The grenade/dynamite static JSON copies were removed in favor of datagen ownership.

### Already in place from the initial NeoForge port
The following 2.2.2-Fabric fixes were already shipped in the 2.2.1-neoforge initial release and required no changes for parity:
- Overpowered armor effects honor `Config.overpowerEnabled` and `Config.opArmorEffectsEnabled` (`ModArmorItem.inventoryTick`).
- Overpowered armor aura particles drawn per-piece worn (1–4 stacking), gated on config flags, with radial cos/sin pattern and 50/50 SOUL_FIRE_FLAME / ENCHANT mix.
- Ghost spawn placement uses `SpawnPlacementTypes.NO_RESTRICTIONS` (NeoForge equivalent of Fabric's `UNRESTRICTED`) so ghosts can spawn floating.
- No orphan `rgold_from_blasting_rgold` / `rgold_from_smelting_rgold` advancements present.

## 2.2.1-1.21.1-neoforge

Initial NeoForge 1.21.1 release, ported from the Forge 1.21.1 source. Feature parity with the Forge variant.

### Compatibility

- Minecraft 1.21.1
- NeoForge 21.1.219+

### Optional integrations

- JEI 19.27.0.340+ — Spectral Infuser recipe category
- WTHIT (waila) 12.10.1+ — Ghost ectoplasm armor info
- Cloth Config 15.0.140+ — In-game config screen

### Port notes

- Migrated from Forge APIs to NeoForge equivalents (`net.minecraftforge.*` → `net.neoforged.neoforge.*`, `RegistryObject` → `DeferredHolder`, `ForgeTier` → `SimpleTier`, etc.)
- Tick events updated to NeoForge's split `PlayerTickEvent.Post` / `LevelTickEvent.Post`
- `LivingHurtEvent` → `LivingIncomingDamageEvent`, `MobSpawnEvent.FinalizeSpawn` → `FinalizeSpawnEvent`
- Menu screen registration moved to `RegisterMenuScreensEvent`
- Biome modifier JSONs relocated to the `neoforge:` namespace, fixing a silent ore-generation failure in pre-release builds
